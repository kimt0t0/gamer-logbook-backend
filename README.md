# Gamer Logbook - BackEnd

## Presentation

This is the backend application for Gamer Logbook.

Gamer Logbook is a web application designed to help videogames players to take notes on their journey in any game(s) of their choice.
Users should be able to signup with just a valid email address, and easily create a new journal for any game to take notes on quests, discoveries, things they want to remember or do later in the game, skills to build-up in the game, etc.
The aim is to be able to read and update gaming notes anywhere at anytime, from any device.

This API is designed to work with a PostgreSQL database.
